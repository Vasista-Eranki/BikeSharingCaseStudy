## General Information

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

We're tasked to build a model, which will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions

* There seems to be a +ve increase in the counts of BikeSharing in the year 2019 when compared to 2018.
* There is a decrease of BikeSharing during the holidays.
* There seems to be a +ve increase in the BikeSharing during good temperatures. 
* There seems to be a -ve impact of windspeed for the BikeSharing. i.e., the BikeSharing is less observed when the windspeed is more (given the case rest all the factors are constant).
* Winter and Summer seasons show a +ve trend for the BikeSharing.
* The Mist and Snow weathers result in a -ve trend for the BikeSharing.
* The months August and September turned up to be having a good business for BikeSharing..
